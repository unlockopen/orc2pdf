It enumerates a set of fundamental practices that manufacturers of smart home and wearable devices, for instance, should implement to significantly improve security. Notable provisions include: avoiding universal default passwords (each device must have a unique or user-set credential), providing a means to manage vulnerability disclosure (publish a contact for security issues), keeping software updated (and informing consumers of update duration), securely storing sensitive data, and minimizing exposed attack surfaces. The standard, first released in 2020 (and updated in v2.1.1 to refine requirements), has 13 key provisions in total. While voluntary, EN 303 645 has become highly influential; its guidelines have been adopted or referenced by governments and industry schemes globally (such as in the UK’s and Australia’s IoT codes of practice and Singapore’s CLS levels). In summary, ETSI EN 303 645 serves as a baseline “security hygiene” checklist for IoT products to reduce common vulnerabilities and make consumer devices more resilient against attacks like botnet recruitment or data breaches.</p>

Rather than prescribing a specific technique, it outlines a framework and process that organizations can use to identify, assess, and treat risks systematically. Key concepts include establishing the context of risk (understanding the internal and external environment), performing structured risk assessments (identifying risks, analyzing their likelihood and impact, evaluating priorities), and then treating the risks with appropriate controls or mitigation strategies. The standard emphasizes that risk management should be iterative and embedded into organizational processes, decision-making, and culture. By following ISO 31000’s guidelines, organizations of any type can improve their ability to manage uncertainty, minimize losses, and maximize opportunities in a rational, auditable way.</p>

The RMF provides a disciplined, structured process that integrates security and privacy into the system development life cycle. The steps of the RMF include: Prepare (organizational and system level preparation for risk management), Categorize (determining the system’s impact level in terms of confidentiality, integrity, availability), Select (choosing an initial set of security and privacy controls from standards like NIST 800-53 based on that categorization and tailoring them as needed), Implement (putting the controls in place), Assess (evaluating how effectively the controls are implemented), Authorize (a senior official formally accepting the residual risk before the system operates), and Monitor (continuously tracking the system’s security posture and control effectiveness over time). Rev. 2 of SP 800-37, published in 2018, updated the process to better support organization-wide risk management, emphasized the importance of privacy, and aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. It promotes ongoing authorization and continuous monitoring rather than one-time snapshots. Utilizing RMF helps organizations (especially U.S. federal agencies and contractors) ensure that security is not an afterthought but a continuous, lifecycle concern tied to risk decisions.</p>

It adopts a systems security engineering perspective, meaning it embeds resilience into the system design lifecycle. The document introduces a catalog of cyber resiliency techniques and approaches — for example, techniques like redundancy (having backup components), diversity (using different implementations to avoid common-mode failures), segmentation (limiting the blast radius of compromises), deception (confusing or slowing attackers), and graceful degradation (maintaining partial functionality under stress). Rev. 1 updates these concepts and provides use cases and mappings to known frameworks (like mapping resiliency techniques to NIST CSF functions). By applying the guidance in SP 800-160 Vol. 2, system architects and engineers can design systems that continue to operate even while under attack or after compromise, thereby protecting critical missions. The document essentially shifts the focus from just preventing breaches to assuming that incidents will happen and planning how the system will cope and adapt when they do.</p>

Version 1.1 of the SSDF (published in 2022) organizes these practices into four groups: Prepare the Organization (ensure the development team has the resources, training, and governance to produce secure code), Protect the Software (establish secure environments and tools, and protect code integrity – e.g., via version control protections and dependency management), Produce Well-Secured Software (implement security design, code, and testing practices – like threat modeling, static analysis, and code review – and address findings), and Respond to Vulnerabilities (define processes to handle internally and externally reported bugs in released software, including patching and communication). Each practice is described at a high level with mappings to more specific standards (like OWASP, ISO, etc.). The SSDF is meant to be adaptable: organizations of any size can implement its core tenets and can integrate them into existing development workflows (waterfall, Agile, DevOps, etc.). By following the SSDF, software producers minimize the introduction of vulnerabilities and establish a workflow to catch and fix security issues early, which ultimately leads to more secure products for end users.</p>

As of August 2024, certain radio-connected devices (including many IoT products) must comply with Article 3(3)(d)-(f) of the RED, which mandates network protection, privacy of data, and fraud prevention. EN 18031-1 provides the “common security requirements” that manufacturers can implement to meet these legal obligations. It likely covers a broad set of controls such as requiring authentication for critical functions, ensuring secure data transmission, protecting personal data handled by the equipment, and maintaining software update mechanisms. This standard builds on prior work (like ETSI EN 303 645) but formalizes it under CEN/CENELEC for regulatory conformity. By following EN 18031-1, manufacturers can self-declare or certify that their wireless and IoT products adhere to the necessary cybersecurity baseline, thereby fulfilling the RED requirements and allowing them to be placed on the EU market. Essentially, EN 18031-1 operationalizes the Cyber Resilience Act’s spirit early for radio devices, harmonizing security across all consumer smart products in Europe.</p>

The cheat sheet outlines the essential steps in threat modeling: defining the security objectives, creating an application diagram or understanding the architecture, identifying threats (often using frameworks like STRIDE: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege), and devising mitigations for those threats. It provides tips and best practices, such as focusing on high-risk assets, involving diverse stakeholders (developers, architects, security engineers), and iterating the threat model as the design evolves. By following this concise guide, developers and teams can ensure they consider security early in the development lifecycle—modeling what could go wrong and building in defenses—rather than reacting to issues late in the game.</p>

It provides practical recommendations on compiler options that enable various hardening mechanisms. Examples include turning on stack canaries and stack overflow protections (-fstack-protector-strong), using address space layout randomization friendly flags (-fPIE for position-independent executables, and linking with -pie), enabling control-flow integrity or forward-edge protections (if supported by the compiler toolchain), enabling warnings and treating them as errors for risky patterns, and using memory sanitization tools in testing builds. The guide may also discuss choices like enabling Fortify Source (to catch certain buffer overflows at runtime) and using latest standards (e.g. C11/C17 features that improve safety). Each suggested option is explained in terms of what security benefit it provides and any trade-offs (such as performance impact or compatibility). Following this hardening guide helps developers raise the baseline security of their C/C++ applications, making them more resistant to common memory corruption vulnerabilities by catching issues early or making exploitation much more difficult.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework">NIST Cybersecurity Framework</a> - The NIST CSF is a high-level framework that helps organizations manage and reduce cybersecurity risk. It is composed of five Core Functions: Identify (know your assets, systems, data, and risks), Protect (implement safeguards like access controls, training, maintenance), Detect (deploy activities to promptly detect anomalies and incidents), Respond (have plans and actions for containing and minimizing incidents), and Recover (restore any capabilities or services impaired by incidents and incorporate lessons learned). Under each function are Categories and Subcategories that outline specific outcomes (for example, under Protect -&gt; Access Control, an outcome is “identities and credentials are managed for authorized devices and users”). The CSF also includes Implementation Tiers to gauge the maturity of risk management practices and a Profile concept to tailor the framework to the organization’s goals and sector. Initially developed for critical infrastructure, the CSF has been widely adopted across industries globally because of its flexibility and clear structure. It’s often used as a starting point for developing a cybersecurity program or as a communication tool between technical teams and management, since it distills complex security practices into a straightforward, business-aligned format. (Note: A CSF 2.0 update is underway to incorporate more guidance on governance and supply chain risk.)</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.opencompute.org/documents/secure-boot-2-pdf">Hardware Secure Boot</a> - This guide from the Open Compute Project (OCP) provides design requirements and recommendations for implementing secure boot in hardware systems (like servers or network devices). Secure boot is a mechanism where the system’s boot firmware (BIOS/UEFI or similar) will only execute code that is cryptographically signed by a trusted authority. The OCP guide likely details how to establish a root of trust in hardware (such as using a TPM or dedicated secure element to store cryptographic keys), how to sign bootloaders and OS kernels, and how the verification process should work at each stage of the boot chain. It may also discuss managing keys (for example, allowing owners to enroll their own keys or update keys securely) and handling firmware updates in a secure manner (ensuring updates are signed and verified). By adhering to this guide, manufacturers can ensure their devices are protected against low-level malware: even if an attacker has physical access or can alter the boot device, the system will refuse to run untrusted boot code, thus preventing persistent malware like rootkits from taking hold. In summary, the OCP Secure Boot Guide is a blueprint for building devices that only run authentic, untampered software from power-on through full system startup.</p>

Revision 5, released in 2020, expanded the catalog to integrate privacy fully alongside security and made the language more outcome-based (less federal-centric), so it’s usable by a wider audience (government, industry, international). The catalog is organized into families like Access Control, Incident Response, Cryptography, Personnel Security, etc., each containing specific controls. For example, in Access Control, one control is implementing role-based access with the principle of least privilege. Rev. 5 introduced new control families for areas like Supply Chain Risk Management, refined controls for advanced technologies (IoT, mobile), and removed the concept of “low/medium/high baselines” from the document itself (that moved to separate guidance) to focus on the controls. An organization using SP 800-53 will select a subset of these controls based on its risk assessment (often guided by frameworks like SP 800-37 RMF) and then implement and document them. SP 800-53 is widely used not only by U.S. federal agencies (it’s the backbone of FedRAMP, DoD, etc. requirements) but also by others as a rich reference of security best practices to draw from when securing systems.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/">OWASP Application Security Verification Standard</a> - The OWASP ASVS is a framework that provides a checklist of application security requirements and controls in a structured manner, serving as a basis for testing web application security. It defines three levels of verification depth: Level 1 (basic, for all applications) through Level 3 (advanced, for the most critical applications). Each level comprises requirements across categories such as Authentication, Access Control, Data Protection, Error Handling, and others. For example, at Level 1, there might be a requirement that the application has no default passwords and uses HTTPS; at higher levels, requirements become more stringent, like implementing strong multi-factor authentication, or using cryptographic modules with specific certifications. Developers and architects can use ASVS during development to ensure they build in these controls, and security testers can use it as a guide for what to verify (it’s often used to structure penetration testing or security code review efforts). By using ASVS, organizations get a common language for what it means for an application to be “secure” at a given level, and they can assert compliance to that level. Ultimately, ASVS helps raise the security baseline by providing clear, measurable security criteria for applications.</p>

Unlike vulnerability databases (which catalog specific instances of bugs in products), the BF provides a methodology and language to define classes of bugs in a rigorous way. It builds on concepts from existing taxonomies like CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) but adds formal structure, making it easier to see the relations between bugs. For example, the framework may define a hierarchy or mapping of how a higher-level weakness (say “Improper Input Validation”) can manifest as different lower-level bug types in certain contexts. It likely introduces a model to reason from root causes to impacts. The intent is to aid tools and researchers: with a formal bug definition language, static analysis tools or formal methods can more precisely identify and categorize issues, and data analysts can better aggregate and compare vulnerability information across different sources. In essence, SP 800-231 is bringing scientific rigor to how we classify software flaws, which can improve communication (everyone uses terms the same way), allow for more automation in vulnerability management, and potentially help discover logical gaps in existing security coverage.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://certcc.github.io/CERT-Guide-to-CVD/">The CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure</a> - The CERT Guide to Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) is a comprehensive handbook for establishing a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process. Published by the CERT Coordination Center (part of Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute), it walks through the entire lifecycle of handling a discovered security vulnerability when multiple parties are involved (the finder, the affected vendor, possibly intermediaries like bug bounty platforms or coordination centers). The guide covers fundamental concepts and roles (what it means to be a finder, vendor, coordinator), and lays out best practices on how to receive vulnerability reports, triage and analyze them, communicate between researchers and vendors, remediate the issues, and eventually disclose the vulnerability publicly in a responsible manner. It addresses challenges such as multi-vendor coordination (when a vulnerability affects multiple products) and dealing with disagreements or communication breakdowns. By following the CERT Guide, organizations can improve how they respond to vulnerability reports, ensuring that fixes are developed and delivered to users faster and with less conflict, ultimately reducing harm from security flaws. The <a href="https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/documents/1945/2017_003_001_503340.pdf">original guide</a> also exists as a PDF.</p>

It stresses the importance of timely patching as a critical defense against exploits of known vulnerabilities. Key recommendations include maintaining an inventory of all IT assets to know what needs patching, categorizing updates by severity and applying critical security patches as soon as possible (ideally within a defined timeframe like 48-72 hours for high severity), and establishing a regular patch cycle for less urgent updates. The guidelines also suggest testing patches in a staging environment when feasible, having a rollback plan in case an update causes issues, and using automated management tools to deploy patches at scale across an organization’s devices. Additionally, the document might cover how to handle systems that can’t be patched (due to compatibility or support issues), such as isolating them or applying compensating controls. Overall, the Berkeley guidelines serve as a practical manual for IT teams to build a robust patch management process, which in turn reduces an organization’s exposure to known exploits.</p>

This standard formalizes the schema and usage of CycloneDX for creating Software Bills of Materials, which enumerate the components and dependencies in a software product. ECMA-424 (CycloneDX v1.6) defines how to represent components, their licenses, version information, relationships, and relevant metadata (like hashes, integrity proofs, and known vulnerabilities) in a machine-readable way. The publication of CycloneDX as ECMA-424 means it is a globally recognized specification, facilitating widespread adoption. It enables organizations to exchange SBOM information consistently across tools and industries, enhancing transparency and helping stakeholders (developers, consumers, regulators) to track and manage supply chain risk by knowing exactly what is inside a software product.</p>

It examines current challenges in software identification and reviews existing identifier schemes, highlighting issues like naming inconsistencies and ephemerality. In response, the authors advocate for Software Heritage persistent IDs (SWHIDs), which are content-derived, permanent identifiers, as a unified solution for tracking software artifacts across systems. The report emphasizes that SWHIDs would facilitate better vulnerability management and transparency, aligning with emerging regulatory requirements (such as the EU Cyber Resilience Act and U.S. executive orders) by ensuring every component in the supply chain can be traced and verified in a stable, tool-agnostic manner.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec">Unique identifier for software components (ECMA International)</a> - The Package URL specification defines a standard way to identify software packages across different programming ecosystems using a simple, URL-like format. A “purl” takes the form of a URI that includes a package’s type (e.g. npm, Maven, PyPI, GitHub), the namespace or group (if applicable), the package name, version, and any qualifiers or subpath. For example, a purl might look like: pkg:maven/org.apache.commons/<a href="mailto:commons-lang3@3.12.0">commons-lang3@3.12.0</a>. This one identifier concisely tells you the package manager (Maven), group (org.apache.commons), artifact (commons-lang3), and version (3.12.0). The purl spec, maintained on GitHub, has become widely used in tools and SBOM formats because it provides a consistent way to refer to components. It helps automate the tracking of dependencies, vulnerability matching (linking known vulnerabilities to package coordinates), and license compliance, since every package instance can be referenced uniformly. In summary, Package URL is like a universal addressing system for software components, making it easier to integrate data about packages across different systems and databases.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.swhid.org/specification">Unique identifier for software components (Software Heritage)</a> - The Software Heritage ID is a scheme for assigning permanent, unique identifiers to software artifacts (such as source code files, commits, or releases) based on their content. The specification (developed by the Software Heritage archive) defines a cryptographic hash-based ID format that includes a prefix (swh:), a content hash, and additional qualifiers to denote the type of artifact and its position in the archive’s Merkle graph. For example, there are SWHIDs for files (blobs), directories (which list files), commits (snapshots of directories with metadata), and releases (tags). Because SWHIDs are content-derived, they are immutable and globally unique: the same piece of code will always have the same SWHID. This system enables precise references to software components regardless of where they are stored or how they are named elsewhere. In practice, SWHIDs facilitate long-term preservation, citation, and tracking of software, since one can resolve an SWHID via the Software Heritage archive to retrieve the exact artifact, and they help with supply chain integrity by ensuring that references to source code are unambiguous and verifiable.</p>

The linked document on software use cases describes scenarios where organizations need a verifiable record of actions in the supply chain. For example, one use case might be tracking the provenance of a piece of code: a developer commits code and signs it, a build service records that it built a binary from specific source, a scanner logs that it scanned the binary for vulnerabilities, etc. SCITT envisions a tamper-evident ledger (possibly blockchain-like or using transparency logs) where each of these actions is recorded by actors with cryptographic signatures. The use case document illustrates how this can help – for instance, a consumer of software can query the ledger to see if a given software package version has a recorded build attestation and security scan results before trusting it. Another use case could involve regulatory compliance: proving to an auditor that every software component in a device went through certain security checks. By enumerating such cases, the document guides the design of the SCITT architecture to ensure it meets real-world needs. In essence, SCITT’s use cases highlight the forthcoming ability to establish a chain of trust for software artifacts through standardized evidence, improving the integrity and transparency of the software supply chain.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://energycentral.com/c/iu/facts-and-opinions-about-sbom-implementation-and-adoption">Lessons Learned during SBOM Implementation and Adoption</a> - This article, written by a practitioner with extensive experience in SBOMs, shares practical insights and opinions on the current state of SBOM usage. One key point the author makes is that the only authoritative SBOM for a product should come from its original producer – they have the best knowledge of the components. However, even producers might not have perfect insight into every sub-component, especially when they incorporate third-party elements, highlighting the need for upstream component transparency. The author argues against waiting for SBOM technology to be “perfect” or universally adopted; even imperfect SBOMs provide significant value right now by giving visibility into software contents and risks. The article notes that many tools and a vibrant community already exist to help generate and use SBOMs, debunking the myth that SBOM is immature. It also reminds readers that there are two well-established SBOM standards (CycloneDX and SPDX) that are sufficient for current needs. The author cautions that there are both proponents and detractors of SBOMs speaking in the industry, and suggests readers do their own evaluations – in other words, experiment with SBOMs on their own software to see the benefits firsthand. Overall, the piece encourages organizations to start integrating SBOM practices into their workflows today, to improve software risk management and comply with emerging requirements, rather than adopting a “wait and see” approach.</p>

It likely advises agencies to use automated tools to parse SBOM data to identify components and check them against vulnerability databases (so if a vendor provides an SBOM, the agency can quickly see if any included library has known flaws). It also covers establishing workflows to manage SBOM data at scale – for example, keeping a repository of SBOMs for all software in use, updating it when software is patched or upgraded, and integrating SBOM review into continuous monitoring. The guide emphasizes that simply obtaining SBOMs is not the end goal; organizations must also develop the capability to act on SBOM information (like prioritizing patches or isolating systems when a critical vulnerability in a common component emerges). By following these guidelines, government enterprises can move toward proactive supply chain security management, gaining visibility into their software assets and being better prepared to respond to new threats or compliance checks (like those required by EO mandates).</p>

<li><p><a href="https://cisa.gov/sag">CISA Software Acquisition Guide</a> - The U.S. CISA Software Acquisition Guide provides practical guidance to government agencies (and large enterprises) on how to incorporate security considerations into the procurement of software. It outlines how buyers should define security requirements in RFPs/contracts – such as requiring vendors to follow secure development standards (like the NIST SSDF), provide artifacts like SBOMs and vulnerability disclosure policies, and agree to notify and patch if vulnerabilities are found. It also advises on evaluating supplier risk (e.g. checking if the vendor has had frequent security issues historically or if they have certified processes like ISO 27001). The guide suggests structuring the vendor selection process to include security questionnaires or assessments and to prefer vendors who can demonstrate secure-by-design approaches (perhaps via certifications or past performance). Additionally, it covers how to handle acquired software: establishing processes for incoming SBOM analysis, periodic re-scans for vulnerabilities in the product, and ensuring maintenance contracts cover security updates. By following this guide, procurement officers and risk managers can make more informed decisions, selecting products that not only meet functionality needs but also contribute positively to the organization’s security posture, thereby using market forces to encourage vendors to deliver safer software.</p>

It identifies common attack scenarios and weaknesses in digital supply chains (such as compromise of third-party software dependencies, insecure equipment from suppliers, or poor internal supplier security processes). The document then presents a set of good practices for different stakeholders – including manufacturers, service providers, and customers – to mitigate these risks. These practices range from performing due diligence and security audits on suppliers, incorporating security requirements into procurement contracts, ensuring suppliers have vulnerability management and incident response procedures, to establishing multi-tier trust (so that suppliers enforce similar standards on their subcontractors). By following these practices, organizations can strengthen the weakest links in their supply chain and reduce the risk of cascading security incidents originating from outside partners or components.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/secure-software-development-self-attestation-resources-and-knowledge/">NASA procurement practices and process</a> - In response to federal requirements (stemming from Executive Order 14028) that government agencies only use software following secure development practices, NASA has instituted a process where software suppliers must self-attest to their security. NASA’s public resources for this include guidance and forms for vendors. Essentially, a contractor providing software to NASA needs to review their own software development processes against criteria (largely drawn from NIST’s Secure Software Development Framework and related guidance) and then sign a statement confirming they comply. The NASA site likely provides a checklist or template covering topics like: does the vendor conduct threat modeling? Do they run static code analysis? How do they manage third-party component vulnerabilities? etc. It might also have educational material to help suppliers understand what practices are expected. By implementing this attestation process, NASA ensures its contractors are consciously evaluating and improving their security postures. This ultimately reduces risk in NASA’s supply chain—only software built with a baseline of security best practices should be running in NASA environments—and it reinforces industry adoption of secure development norms.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa">SLSA Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts</a> - SLSA (pronounced “salsa”) is a security framework for improving software supply chain integrity, created by a consortium of industry leaders. It defines a maturity model with four levels that software producers can achieve, each level adding more advanced supply chain protections. At Level 1, basic requirements like using version control and build scripts are in place. By Level 2, tamper-evident builds are required (e.g. generating provenance metadata). Level 3 mandates trusted, verifiable builds (such as using a dedicated, isolated build service to prevent interference), and Level 4 involves the highest assurances including two-party review of all changes and a hermetic, reproducible build process. The framework is documented openly (on GitHub) and provides specifications for how to produce attestations (metadata) that a build meets a certain SLSA level. The purpose of SLSA is to thwart supply chain attacks (like code tampering, compromised dependencies, etc.) by incrementally hardening the build and release process. Organizations can adopt SLSA guidelines to progressively make their software build pipelines more secure, and customers can eventually prefer software that comes with SLSA provenance, indicating it was built under strict controls.</p>

<li><p><a href="">Australia Code of Practice - Securing the Internet of Things for Consumers</a> - Australia released a voluntary Code of Practice for consumer IoT security in 2020 (developed by the Department of Home Affairs). This code closely mirrors the UK’s 13 IoT security principles and ETSI’s guidelines. It includes practices such as: don’t use default passwords (and preferably implement unique passwords per device), implement a vulnerability disclosure policy, keep software updated and securely updateable, securely store credentials, minimize data collection, and ensure devices can be securely deleted or reset by users. The Australian Code of Practice serves as guidance for industry; while not legally binding, it was endorsed by the government as the expected norm. Companies are encouraged to adopt it and even use it as a competitive advantage (demonstrating compliance could be marketed to consumers). The code also set the stage for potential future regulation if voluntary uptake is insufficient. By articulating clear best practices, Australia’s government aimed to elevate IoT security and protect Australian consumers from common IoT threats like unauthorized access or data breaches via their smart devices. The principles from this code of practice have since influenced discussions on IoT security regulation and labeling in Australia (such as the work towards an IoT security “star rating” similar to other countries).</p>

<li><a href="">Finland’s national consumer IoT certification scheme</a> -  Finland was a pioneer in Europe for consumer IoT security certification, launching its cybersecurity label program in 2019. In this scheme run by Traficom (the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency), manufacturers can apply to have their smart products evaluated against a set of security criteria. Certified products receive a “Cybersecurity Label” (Tietoturvamerkki in Finnish) that they can display to inform consumers that the device meets Finland’s security requirements. The criteria include things like no default passwords, secure communications, and a commitment by the vendor to update the product’s software to fix vulnerabilities. The Finnish label is voluntary but has seen adoption in products like smart watches, home hubs, and IoT appliances. The program’s goal is to raise consumer awareness and reward companies that invest in security. Finland’s label has gained international recognition – it has mutual recognition with Singapore’s CLS (whereby a product meeting the Finnish label is accepted as Level 3 in Singapore’s scheme). This national certification helps build trust in IoT products and influenced the development of similar labeling efforts across the EU.  <div class="cartouche"><div><strong>Title: </strong> Finland’s national consumer IoT certification scheme</div></div></li>

This is a voluntary label that manufacturers can obtain to signal that their product meets basic cybersecurity requirements and that the manufacturer is transparent about its security features. Rather than extensive lab testing, the BSI label currently works as a self-declaration: the manufacturer commits to certain practices (for example, providing software updates for a minimum period, and having no universal default passwords) and BSI publishes a webpage for each labeled product detailing its security properties and update policy. The label itself is often a QR code that consumers can scan to read those details on BSI’s website. This approach educates consumers on what the device does for security and what they as users should do (like applying updates). Products like routers, smart TVs, and cameras have started getting the label. The label program also ties into international efforts: Germany and Singapore have a mutual recognition arrangement (devices with Germany’s label count as at least CLS Level 2 in Singapore and vice versa). Overall, the BSI IT Security Label aims to increase IoT product security through transparency and by pushing manufacturers to adhere to baseline good practices in order to earn the official recognition.  <div class="cartouche"><div><strong>Title: </strong> Germany BSI IoT label</div><div class="cartouche-url"><strong>URL:&nbsp;</strong>https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Themen/Unternehmen-und-Organisationen/IT-Sicherheitskennzeichen/it-sicherheitskennzeichen_node.html</div></div></li>

This code of practice is largely aligned with global benchmarks like ETSI EN 303 645 and the UK’s 13 principles for IoT security. It provides a list of best practices that manufacturers should implement: some examples include using unique per-device passwords, implementing a vulnerability disclosure mechanism, securing personal data, ensuring communications are encrypted, and providing software updates to devices. While not a regulation, this document serves as an official reference for what the Indian government expects in terms of IoT device security. It’s intended for device manufacturers, IoT service providers, and app developers to consult and adopt these measures in their products and services. By following the TEC’s code, IoT companies can significantly raise the security level of their products in India, and it prepares them for any future mandatory requirements. The issuance of this guideline reflects India’s recognition of the growing risks posed by the proliferation of IoT devices and the need to protect consumers and critical networks from those risks.</p>

Building on prior voluntary guidelines, it makes certain practices legally mandatory for manufacturers, importers, and distributors in the UK. The Act’s first set of requirements (which will be enforced via secondary regulations) include: banning universal default passwords in devices, requiring a public point of contact for vulnerability reporting, and mandating transparency about the minimum time period during which the device will receive security updates. Manufacturers must provide a compliance statement for their products covering these aspects. The law gives regulators power to fine companies that don’t comply. Essentially, PSTI turns basic IoT security principles into law – for example, if a toy or appliance ships with a default password like “admin” that is not unique, that will be illegal to sell in the UK. The Act also gives the government flexibility to expand requirements over time (it can add further provisions like mandates around data encryption or firewalls if needed). By legislating these measures, the UK aims to remove the most egregious vulnerabilities from consumer devices and drive manufacturers globally to improve the security of the products that end up in British households.</p>

The pledge outlines core principles such as developing software with a proactive adversary mindset (anticipating how software could be misused or attacked), ensuring default configurations are secure out-of-the-box (so customers don’t have to harden products themselves), practicing transparency in vulnerability handling (including publishing SBOMs and disclosing vulnerabilities), and enabling continuous security testing and feedback during development. Companies that take the pledge publicly commit to these values, signaling that they will invest in practices like threat modeling, secure coding training, rigorous testing, and building security features (like authentication and encryption) as integral parts of their products. The broader goal is cultural: to move the industry away from treating security as an afterthought or add-on, and instead have security as a foundational aspect of product design, thereby reducing the prevalence of easily exploitable weaknesses in widely used technology.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.csa.gov.sg/our-programmes/certification-and-labelling-schemes/cybersecurity-labelling-scheme/about/">Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme for IoT - CLS(IoT)</a> - Singapore’s Cybersecurity Labelling Scheme is a four-tier rating program launched in 2020 by the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) to improve the security of consumer smart devices. Under CLS, IoT products (like home routers, smart cameras, etc.) are evaluated and given a security grade of Level 1 (basic) to Level 4 (most robust), indicated by the number of stars on the label. Each level corresponds to a set of cybersecurity provisions: for example, Level 1 requires adherence to baseline security requirements (largely based on ETSI EN 303 645), higher levels add requirements like using a vetted standard (Level 2), conducting structured lifecycle security measures and binary analysis (Level 3), and perhaps formal certification or penetration testing (Level 4). The label helps consumers easily identify products with better cybersecurity and incentivizes manufacturers to incorporate stronger security into design to achieve higher ratings. Singapore’s CLS is one of the first schemes of its kind in Asia and includes mutual recognition arrangements (e.g., a device meeting Finland’s cybersecurity label is recognized at CLS Level 3, and vice versa), promoting international coherence in IoT security standards.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/CyberTrustMark">CyberTrust Mark</a> - The Cyber Trust Mark is a forthcoming labeling scheme introduced by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to signify consumer IoT products that meet certain cybersecurity benchmarks. Under this program, makers of smart devices (like smart thermostats, fitness trackers, connected appliances, etc.) can voluntarily undergo an evaluation of their product’s security features. The baseline criteria likely include things like: unique default passwords or user setup of credentials, a commitment to provide security updates for a minimum period, having a vulnerability reporting mechanism, and perhaps compliance with standards such as ETSI EN 303 645. Devices that pass the evaluation will be allowed to display the “Cyber Trust Mark” logo (possibly a shield icon or similar) on their packaging. This functions similarly to an EnergyStar label but for cybersecurity. The idea is to help consumers easily identify products that are deemed more secure, thereby encouraging manufacturers to improve security to earn the mark. Over time, widespread adoption of the Cyber Trust Mark aims to raise the minimum security level of IoT devices available in the U.S. market by combining consumer choice with a recognizable seal of approval for security.</p>

The Executive Order mandates that federal agencies, when buying software or connected devices, must ensure those products meet rigorous cybersecurity standards – effectively using government contracts as a driver for better security. It tasks NIST and other agencies with establishing what technical evidence or certifications a vendor must provide to be considered trustworthy. This could include providing an SBOM for supplied software, proving that the software was developed under secure processes (via self-attestation or third-party audit), demonstrating compliance with specific standards (like FIPS-validated cryptography, or adherence to zero-trust principles if relevant), and ensuring mechanisms for swift vulnerability remediation. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) will be updated accordingly, making these requirements legally binding in contracts. In practical terms, this means a software company wanting to sell to the U.S. government will need to implement robust security in their product and supply chain or risk being excluded. The intent is both to protect government systems from supply chain attacks and to influence the broader market: when large vendors improve security to sell to the government, those improvements often propagate to all customers.</p>

<li><p><a href="">Vietnam’s Cyber Information Security Requirements for Internet of things</a> - In 2021, Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications issued a set of baseline cybersecurity requirements for consumer Internet-of-Things devices (for example, network cameras, Wi-Fi routers, and smart home gadgets). This was formalized in a decision (Decision 736/QD-BTTTT) that lists mandatory security features for IoT products in Vietnam. These requirements include having unique default credentials or forcing password changes on setup, providing secure update mechanisms for device firmware, implementing data protection measures, and ensuring devices undergo security testing. The regulation also often requires manufacturers to have a point of contact for vulnerability reporting. Vietnam’s move mirrors the global trend initiated by standards like ETSI EN 303 645 but makes it enforceable within the country’s jurisdiction. Manufacturers of IoT devices in Vietnam (or exporters to Vietnam) need to comply with these rules to sell their products legally. The aim is to reduce the prevalence of easily exploitable IoT devices (which could be hijacked for botnets or spying) on the Vietnamese market, thereby enhancing overall cyber hygiene and protecting consumers.</p>

The CRA will impose certain security and compliance requirements on “products with digital elements.” Many open source maintainers are concerned about how to meet these obligations. The guide likely breaks down the CRA’s key requirements – such as providing security support and updates for a product, having a vulnerability disclosure process, ensuring the software is developed following secure practices, and including technical documentation – and offers suggestions for open source projects to address them. It might recommend things like adopting an open source security best practices badge (to show development follows guidelines), publishing an SBOM for releases, clearly stating how users will be alerted to issues or updates, and possibly working with downstream distributors who can help fulfill CRA duties. It also may clarify which open source scenarios are out of scope of the CRA (for example, maybe software provided without commercial intent). In short, this compliance guide serves as a bridge to help the open source community understand and prepare for the new regulatory landscape under the CRA, aiming to ensure that open source can remain sustainable and trusted under these rules.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-resilience-act-requirements-standards-mapping">Cyber Resilience Act Requirements Standards Mapping - Joint Research Centre &amp; ENISA Joint Analysis</a> - This joint analysis report by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) and ENISA examines how existing cybersecurity standards relate to the requirements of the proposed Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). The CRA will impose certain security requirements on hardware and software products in the EU, and this report maps each specific CRA requirement (for example, on secure design, vulnerability handling, encryption, etc.) to one or more international or European standards that address that topic. The analysis identifies where suitable standards already exist (and could be used to comply with or demonstrate conformity to that CRA requirement) and where there are gaps (i.e. no current standard fully covers a particular requirement, indicating a need for further standardization). This mapping is valuable for industry and regulators: manufacturers can use it to figure out which standards or certifications might help them meet CRA obligations, and standards organizations can see where new work might be needed. Overall, the report serves as a bridge between the high-level legal requirements of the CRA and the practical technical standards that can fulfill them.</p>
